# Brain-Tumour-Detection-
Brain tumor detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is an innovative approach that leverages deep learning techniques to assist in the early diagnosis of brain tumors from medical images such as MRI scans.

In this project, the CNN model is trained on a dataset comprising of thousands of labeled MRI images of both healthy brains and brains with tumors. The CNN learns to automatically extract relevant features from these images through layers of convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.

During the training phase, the CNN adjusts its parameters to minimize the difference between the predicted labels and the actual labels of the images. Once trained, the model can accurately classify new MRI images into two categories: healthy or showing signs of a tumor.

The key advantage of using CNNs for brain tumor detection lies in their ability to learn hierarchical representations of features directly from the images, without requiring manual feature extraction. This makes the process more efficient and potentially more accurate
